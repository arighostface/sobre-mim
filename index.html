<body>things about me</head>


    <h1>random things about me</h1>
    
    <p>I'm Elisabeth, I'm 15 years old, I have somewhat "normal" tastes, I'm going to be informal because if you opened this link it means I gave you access to it. I like dramas, k-pop, rock, rap, anime... I have strange tastes I think my mother said just because I like Elvis I'm strange or Bruno Mars I don't think it's strange it's just a little peculiar and it's kind of rare to find people like that I I don't know how to talk much about myself because I know more.<p>
    <p>Some songs I like, let's pretend this isn't random</p>

<p>I'm a person who trusts a lot and helps a lot without wanting anything in return, I'm creating this page to get to know me without me talking more, yes you can look and see if you want to be friends with me, I'm a person who is very friendly if you want my friendship And just be loyal, don't be false because falsehood only brings falsehood, not on my part, because most of the time I speak without thinking, so I may regret what I say afterward, or it's something that I'm holding on to too much and I'm ruined, I like writing. stories and poems. And no, I don't let you read my poems because they're too personal, they're things I put out so you can read a poem of mine. You have to be very close to me, otherwise there's no point in asking because I won't let you... people, but that's not why I'm stupid enough to expose myself like that</p>
